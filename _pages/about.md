I am a final year PhD student in [Department of Statistics](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) at [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Guodong Li](https://gdli-stat.github.io/). My research interests focus on high dimensional statistics for time series (or other temporal dependent data) and deep learning. In particular, I am interested in exploring various possibilities to apply statistical tools (e.g. time series analysis, tensor methods, non-asymptotic theories) to guide deep network designs (e.g. Transformer, LSTM, ResNet, etc) with certain theoretical guarantees and improved empirical performance.
I received [Hong Kong Postgraduate Fellowship](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) in 2018.
Prior to joining the PhD program, I obtained my bachelor's degree majoring in statistics and quantitative finance with first class honor from University of Hong Kong.
